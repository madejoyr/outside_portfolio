      				Tandem is an online tool designed to help people function better on teams and to help instructors/managers better support those teams.  Currently, Tandem is being used by student teams in a higher education setting.  In the future, we hope to expand to teams in other settings, such as secondary education and industry.  Tandem is being developed by the University of Michigan's Center for Academic Innovation.
 					<br></br>
					Tandem provides both team assessment and team instruction.  We aim to increase transparency on teams and provide timely support and instruction based on each team's experiences.  Using Tandem includes:
				</p>
				</br>
				<ul>
					<li>Personalized Coaching
						<ul>
							<li>Content delivered to students based on how they say their team is doing.</li>
							<li>Lessons on teamwork concepts include messages tailored to individual student attributes.</li>
							<li>Exercises help students create plans, assess on progress, and reflect on their own behaviors.</li>
							<li>Real-time Insights</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Regular student check-in surveys on team function.
						<ul>
							<li>Instructor dashboard to monitor student teams.</li>
							<li>Visualizations to help students see their team’s progression.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Adaptable Features
						<ul>
							<li>Robust system means that each course or setting can set their own schedule, select or add content, and determine what student measures matter to them.</li>
							<li>Instructor views include customizable performance categories to flag teams that could use support.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class='subheader'>Current Areas of Research</h2>
				<br><p>I am not very good at settling down to one topic of research.  There are just too many interesting problems to solve!  This is what I'm currently working on, though.</p></br>
				
				<br><h3>Effects of project-based learning and teams on first-year undergraduate engineering students</h3><br>
				<br><p>I have taught a first-year intro to engineering course for many years, and we are always fiddling with it and trying to make it a better course.  Recently, my co-instructors and I decided to begin assessing whether our chosen approaches are working or not.  We frequently present at the <a href ='http://asee.org/'>ASEE</a> annual conference.</p></br>
				<br><p>I am a faculty collaborator on Tandem, a team support tool being developed by U-M's Center for Academic Innovation.</p></br>

				<br><h3>Effects of implicit bias on obstacles to student learning</h3></br>
				<br><p>Implicit biases are biases we have for or against people and things... but we don't know we have these biases.  We absorb them through the societies that we move through.  An unknown bias can put you in uncomfortable situations by, essentially, making you act like an ignorant idiot when consciously you definitely know better.  By recognizing potential implicit biases, we can bring our brains into the 21st century and make working with each other way more easier and a lot more fun.</p></br>

				<h2 class='subheader'>Past Areas of Research</h2>
				<br><p>These are some things I've worked on in the past.  They'll probably resurface in the future, too.  Circle of life and all that.<p></br>

				<br><h3>Hydrodynamics of marine structures</h3><br>
				<br><p>I conducted research on the hydrodynamics of a variety of marine structures.  Everything from Navy ships to fish spawning reefs.  I primarily used <a href='http://www.openfoam.com/'>OpenFOAM</a> to simulate the fluid flow and around structures.  The simulations were validated against real world data such as model tests, ship sea trials, or river flow data.</p></br>
				
				<br><h3>Design loads for ships and marine structures using probabilistic methods </h3></br>
				<br><p>My dissertation work centered on using extreme value theory to generate extreme ship responses in a rational way.  The details are <a href='http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/58469'>here</a>.  In short, waves that might be dangerous for one ship might NOT be dangerous for a different type of ship.  This approach uses what we know about a given ship's movement in waves to find the waves that will cause big motions of the ship so that you only have to simulate a few cases to produce the extreme stresses the ship or structure will see.  This information can then be handed off to the structural engineers so the ship structure can be designed to withstand these design loads.</p></br>
				<br><p>My original method was improved by the student following me, Dae-Hyun Kim, and the details of his work are <a href='http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/96135'>here</a>.  The result is what we call the Design Loads Generator (DLG), and it runs very quickly because it is based on linear theory.  The output of the DLG are sets of wave conditions that will lead to linear-based extreme responses.  Unfortunately, the entire world is nonlinear.  So, we take the DLG wave conditions and run them through high fidelity nonlinear codes, such as OpenFOAM, to generate more accurate maps of pressure and stress on the marine structure.  </p></br>

				<br><h3>Microplastic pollution in the Great Lakes</h3><br>
				<br><p>I grew up in Benton Harbor/St. Joseph, MI, and the Great Lakes have always been near and dear to my heart.  When I stumbled on the issue of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics'>microplastic pollution</a>, I decided I needed to act.  After all, engineering is causing this problem, so engineering ought to help solve it!  At <a href='http://iaglr.org/'>IAGLR</a> 2014, I chaired a session on microplastic pollution in the Great Lakes, and we brought together many of the active researchers in this area.  This session also supported NOAA's <a href='http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/regional-coordination/great-lakes-action-plan'>Great Lakes Land-based Marine Debris Action Plan</a>.  In 2016, I was part of <a href='http://exxpedition.com/greatlakes2016/'>eXXpedition Great Lakes 2016</a>, in which researchers all around the Great Lakes sampled for microplastics.  </p></br>
